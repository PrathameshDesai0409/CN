Steps for implementing RIP: 
Step1: 
Select Router 1 – select 1841 router and drag it to the screen (Router0). 
Select Switches 1 – select 2950-24 and drag it below the Router0 (Switch0). Select End Device – select Generic and drag it below Switch0 (PC-PT PC0). Select End Device – select Generic and drag it below Switch0 (PC-PT PC1). 
Select Router 2 – select 1841 and drag it to right of the Router0 (Router1). Select Switches 2 – select 2950-24 and drag it below the Router1 (Switch1). Select End Device – select Generic and drag it below Switch1 (PC-PT PC2). Select End Device – select Generic and drag it below Switch1 (PC-PT 
PC3). 
Select Router 3 – select 1841 and drag it to right of the Router0 (Router2). Select Switches 3 – select 2950-24 and drag it below the Router2 (Switch2). Select End Device – select Generic and drag it below Switch0 (PC-PT 
PC4). 
Select End Device – select Generic and drag it below Switch0 (PC-PT 
PC5).

Select Connections – Connect routers, switches and PCs to each other. 
(Router0->switch0->PC0,PC1 | Router1->switch1->PC2,PC3 | 
Router2->switch2->PC4,PC5)

Add Default Gateway and close the window. 
Step 10: 
Click on Router2. Go to Config > FastEthernet0/0. Here, 
add IP Address and On the Port Status.
Step 11: 
Click on Router0. Go to Config > Serial0/0/0 & 
Serial0/0/1 . Here, add IP Address and On the Port 
Status. 
As you will see above, there is green dots which means connections are done successfully between Routers, Switches and PCs. 
Step 12: 
Click on Router1. Go to Config > Serial0/0/0 & 
Serial0/0/1 . Here, add IP Address and On the Port 
Status. 
As you will see above, there is green dots which means connections are done successfully between Routers, Switches and PCs. 
Step 13: 
Click on Router2. Go to Config > Serial0/0/0 & 
Serial0/0/1 . Here, add IP Address and On the Port 
Status. 
As you will see above, there is green dots which means connections are done successfully between Routers, Switches and PCs.. 
Step 14: 
Click on Router0. Go to Config > RIP. 
Here, add the network address to connect router0 with switch0, PC0, PC1, router1 and router2 .
Step 15: 
Click on Router1. Go to Config > RIP. 

Here, add the network address to connect router1 with switch1, PC2, PC3, router0 and router2. 
Step 16: 
Click on Router2. Go to Config > RIP. 

Here, add the network address to connect router2 with switch2, PC4, PC5, router0 and router1. 
Now, all the connections are done successfully.
Final Output :

So, Routing Information Protocol is done 


Steps for implementing VLAN: 
Step1: 
Select Router – select 1841 router and drag it to the screen (Router0). 
Select another Router – select 1841 and drag it to right of the Router0 (Router1). Select Switches – select 2950-24 and drag it below the Router0 (Switch0). 
Select Switches – select 2950-24 and drag it below the Router1 (Switch1). 
Select End Device – select Generic and drag it below Switch0 (PC-PT PC0). Select End Device – select Generic and drag it below Switch1 (PC-PT PC1). Select End Device – select Generic and drag it below Switch1 (PC-PT PC2). Select Connections – Connect routers, switches and PCs to each other. 

Step 2: 
Click on PC0 and go to Desktop > IP Configuration 
Add IP Address, as you will add the IP Address, Subnet Mask will be automatically added and displayed. 
Add Default Gateway and close the window.

Step 3: 
Click on PC1 and go to Desktop > IP Configuration 
Add IP Address, as you will add the IP Address, Subnet Mask will be automatically added and displayed. 
Add Default Gateway and close the window. 

Step 4: 
Click on PC2 and go to Desktop > IP Configuration 
Add IP Address, as you will add the IP Address, Subnet Mask will be automatically added and displayed. 
Add Default Gateway and close the window.

Step 5: 
Click on Router0. Go to Config > FastEthernet0/0. 
Here, add IP Address and On the Port Status. 

Step 6: 
Click on Router1. Go to Config > FastEthernet0/1. Here, 
add IP Address and On the Port Status.

As you will see above, there is green dots which means connections are done successfully between Router, Switches and PCs. 
Step 7: 
Click on Router0. Go to Config > FastEthernet0/1. Here, 
add IP Address and On the Port Status.

Step 8: 
Click on Router1. Go to Config > FastEthernet0/0. Here, 
add IP Address and On the Port Status.


As you can see above, connection is done between both the Routers successfully. 
Step 9: 
Click on Router1. Go to Config > RIP. 
Here, add the network address to connect router1 with switch1, PC1, PC2 and router0. 
Step 10: 
Click on Router0. Go to Config > RIP.
Here, add the network address to connect router0 with switch0, PC0 and router1. 
Now, all the connections are done successfully, you can check it by clicking on this symbol
 
And then, click on any two PCs , you will get the status as successful. 

So till now, Routing Information Protocol is done. Now, 
we will start with implementing VLAN. 
Step 11: 
Add two PC (PC 3 and PC4) and connect it with switch.
 Step 12: 
Click on PC3 and go to Desktop > IP Configuration 
Add IP Address, as you will add the IP Address, Subnet Mask will be automatically added and displayed.

Add Default Gateway and close the window. 
Step 13: 
Click on PC3 and go to Desktop > IP Configuration 
Add IP Address, as you will add the IP Address, Subnet Mask will be automatically added and displayed. 
Add Default Gateway and close the window. 

Step 14: 
Click on Switch1 and go to CLI 
Add type the VLAN code – 
VLAN CODE: 
VLAN 
enable config t 
vlan 20 name 
purchase exit 
vlan 30 name 
sales exit 
int fa0/2 switchport 
access vlan 20 exit 
int fa0/3 switchport 
access vlan 20 
exit 
int fa0/4 switchport 
access vlan 30 exit 
int fa0/5 switchport 
access vlan 30 exit
